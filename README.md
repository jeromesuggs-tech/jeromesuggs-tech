## Hybrid Systems Engineer

I work at the intersection of identity, endpoint management, automation, and real-world enterprise infrastructure.

My focus areas include:

- Microsoft Hybrid Environments (AD + Entra ID)
- Enterprise PowerShell Automation
- Endpoint Lifecycle Engineering
- Intune & Hybrid Join Operations
- Operational Resilience & Recovery

## Current Projects

- Building an Enterprise PowerShell Toolkit
- Documenting Hybrid Identity Failure Patterns

## Philosophy

Automation is not convenience — it is operational survival.

Hybrid environments are not transitional — they are the reality of modern enterprise.
